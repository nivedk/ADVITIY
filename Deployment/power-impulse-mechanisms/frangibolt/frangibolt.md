# FRANGIBOLT

A frangibolt is a device that uses an electric current to fracture a notched bolt, in order to deploy the object.


## HOW IT WORKS

It works on the principle of **Pseudoelastic effect** and **Shape Memory Effect (SME)**.

### GENERAL IDEA
 There are a few materials (SMA shape memory alloys) whose shape changes with temperature. When stress is applied, deformation is observed, this generally recovers, but at a lower temperature,it remains. We an get the original shape again by applying a higher temperature.

The orange part is the SMA with the heater. When current is passed, it is heated up, hence the notched bolt becomes tense and cracks.

## PROS
    - Non destructive
    - Allows repeated testing, hence is cosst efficient
    - Less shock while releasing, hence much better tha npyrotechnic etc, if there are fragile components on board (missions have failed due to high shock from deployment
    

## CONS

    - The response time is not immediate, and is not a fixed value. ~ 30 seconds in the ones I saw
    - Not too powerful (Can be dealt with by using multiple, but then, they might


## SPACE HERITAGE

It has been used in previous space missions. Especially when deployment is required without creating much shock.
* Clementine deployed its solar panels using FRANGIBOLT (1994).
* Used in the Kaber Small Satellite Deployment System on the ISS (2016). [more here](http://nanoracks.com/wp-content/uploads/Kaber-Small-Satellite-Deployment-System-Presentation.pdf)
* Used in Sapphire vehicle separation system(Stanford's first Student Satllite)
* Used in NICER (2016)
