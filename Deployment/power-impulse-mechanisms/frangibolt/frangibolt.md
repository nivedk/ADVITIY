# FRANGIBOLT

A frangibolt is a device that uses an electric current to fracture a notched bolt, in order to deploy the object.

## HOW IT WORKS

It works on the principle of **Pseudoelastic effect** and **Shape Memory Effect (SME)**.

## SPACE HERITAGE

It has been used in previous space missions. Especially when deployment is required without creating much shock.
* Clementine deployed its solar panels using FRANGIBOLT (1994).
* Used in the Kaber Small Satellite Deployment System on the ISS (2016). [more here](http://nanoracks.com/wp-content/uploads/Kaber-Small-Satellite-Deployment-System-Presentation.pdf)
* Used in Sapphire vehicle separation system(Stanford's first Student Satllite)
