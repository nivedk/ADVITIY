PIN PULLER

Way of storing potential energy for one time deployment of the satellite

TYPES OF PINPULLERS

PYROTECHNIC

	- Basically uses an explosive reaction to deploy.

PYROTECHNIC

Widely used for aerospace applications

Nasa Standard Initiator(NSI) driven pin puller is widely tested and modelled.
The NSI is an electrochemical device which is initiated by heating a thin bridgewire surrounded by a pyrotechnic charge.
