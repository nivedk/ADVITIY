PIN PULLER

Way of storing potential energy for one time deployment of the satellite

TYPES OF PINPULLERS

PYROTECHNIC

	- Basically uses an explosive reaction to deploy.

PYROTECHNIC

Widely used for aerospace applications

Nasa Standard Initiator(NSI) driven pin puller is widely tested and modelled.
The NSI is an electrochemical device which is initiated by heating a thin bridgewire surrounded by a pyrotechnic charge.

A detailed paper on how it works can be found [here](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19890005798.pdf)

A basic diagram of the mechanism can be found [here](https://github.com/nivedk/ADVITIY/blob/master/Deployment/power-impulse-mechanisms/pinpulller/NSI-driven-pinpuller.png).

Here are the basic steps:
	-Bridgewire is heated
	-Pyrotechnic is ignited
	-Diaphragm explodes sue to presure build up
	-Due to presure buildup in the expansion chamber, the shear pins fail
	-The shock is reduced using the energy absorbing cup
