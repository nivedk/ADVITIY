Widely used for aerospace applications

Nasa Standard Initiator(NSI) driven pin puller is widely tested and modelled.
The NSI is an electrochemical device which is initiated by heating a thin bridgewire surrounded by a pyrotechnic charge.

A detailed paper on how it works can be found [here](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19890005798.pdf)

Here are the basic steps:

	- Bridgewire is heated
	- Pyrotechnic is ignited
	- Diaphragm explodes sue to presure build up
	- Due to presure buildup in the expansion chamber, the shear pins fail
	- The shock is reduced using the energy absorbing cup
	
It has two NSIs just as a safety precaution in case one fails
	
PROS
=======
### PROS

	- Low power consumption (We don't have to put extra solar panels for one burst of power
	- Cheap
	- Low mass
	- Non Magnetic (so can be placed anywhere on the satellite)
	- High presures generated
	- Quick - respond within seconds (Probably doesn't matter for us)
	
CONS
=======
### CONS

	- Hazardous
	- Pyrotechnic shock(A mars observer satellite mission failed because of this)
	- Safety procedures need to be increased in all stages
	- Need to be installed by a trained technician
	- Neither reusable nor resettable (doesn't matter for us)
