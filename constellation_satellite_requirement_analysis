CONSTELLATION

KICKSAT

    A technology demonstration mission
    Designed to demonstrate the deployment of 104 Sprite “Chipsats” (3.2cm x 3.2cm x a few mm)
    Orbital lifetime of only a few days
    Aim was to advance technologies for low cost ChipSat missions
    A few things we can do with ChipSats
    Large scale in-situ atmospheric survey
    General advantages of chipsats
    ChipSat sensor clouds will allow thousands of data points to be collected simultaneously
    Reduce cost and complexity
    High robustness to individual satellite failures

Each sprite had
---------------
    Solar cells
    Magnetometer
    Gyroscope
    Radio
    Antenna
    
Antenna made of a nickel titanium alloy nitinol. It has the unique property of coming back to its original geometry even after a lot of deformation. Ensuring easy antenna deployment
Didn't have batteries as that would require a temperature maintenance system hence the sprites operate only in sunlight 
Due to licensing constraints the sprites must share a limited band width
Antenna communication was the biggest challenge

Power was 10mW (can’t be increased due to limited surface area for solar panel)
A high gain antenna can’t be used(??)
The signal is less audible than noise

Requirements on OBC
-------------------

    Payload — They didn't have any specific payload so no requirement
    System — Pre flight checks, I don't think they sen any health monitoring data. The main cubesat probably sent down HMD
    Mech — Size! The sprites need to be designed carefully. Even the solar panel is placed directly on the chip
    ADCS — Interface with gyroscope, magnetometer, radio etc
    Actuation — gyro interaction
    Power —  We can’t have large solar panels as it is placed on the chip itself. So need to optimise power consumption as much as possible. No power supply in the ‘night’ so circuit must be designed accordingly. So data must be sent frequently
    Integration — Natural frequency etc. must be taken care of
——————————————————————————————————————
Requirements by OBC
-------------------
    Thermals — No active temperature control system
——————————————————————————————————————
Requirements on power
----------------------

    Don’t have data about power - obc interactions. Power and obc are probably together
—————————————————————————————————————-
Requirements by power
-------------------
    Integration — No shadow on solar panels
    Controls — Orient the chipsat so that the solar panels get the maximum power
    Thermals — Need to ensure the temperature is within acceptable range



AEROCUBE 4

Technology demonstration
Had wings with solar panels to control ballistic coefficient

Requirements on OBC

    ADCS — Interface with sun sensor, GPS, magnetometer, magnetorquer, earth sensor, attitude sensors, formation flying
    Payload — Interface between comm and cameras
    Mech — Size and weight constraint(as it is a cubesat) 
    Comm — Interface with controls and determine when to send data etc. (The satellite   is also reprogrammable)
    Actuation — Magnetorquer and wing interaction
    Power — Has batteries. Requirements probably similar to that of Pratham
    Integration — Natural frequencies shadows etc

———————————————————————————————————————
Requirements by OBC

    Thermals — Maintain suitable temperature ranges
    Power — probably similar to pratham

———————————————————————————————————————
On Power

    Integration — Probably similar to Pratham
    OBC — Probably same as Pratham
    Mainly there isn’t much data on this satellite
